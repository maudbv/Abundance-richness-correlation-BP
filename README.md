# Correlations between species richness and alien species abundance
data import and analyses in R

This respository contains the scripts used to analyse the impact of alien plants on plant diversity 
on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand.
It is ongoing, unfinished work, and still needs quite a lot of cleaning up and code improvement.

The first folder "article 1 - abundance-richness" contains the code used for the 2015 Journal of Ecology paper :
      Bernard-Verdier, M., & Hulme, P.E. 2015. Alien and native plant species play different roles 
      in plant community structure (Y. Buckley, Ed.). Journal of Ecology 103: 143â€“152.
